              <p><small>April/May 2019</small></p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Thank you for letting me talk to you today about one of my passions: shy shelter dogs.</p>

              <p>One of the reasons I got into TTouch was to help the most vulnerable populations of dogs at the shelter in Austin, and I have a particular soft spot for shy dogs.</p>

              <p>I've been to several seminars in this beautiful facility and one of the best ways I could think of to give back is to talk a little about how to help shy shelter dogs.</p>

                <li><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Shy dogs may be at risk for euthanasia</strong> for behaviors they offer, tying up kennels too long, or developing illnesses during long shelter stays.</li>
                <li>The anxiety we see in dogs at the shelter is often <strong style="color:#FF5E99;">entirely due to the shelter environment</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Fearful dogs are often overlooked by volunteers, staff, and adopters</strong> while boisterous dogs demand more attention.</li>
                <li><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">You can make a lot of progress</strong> with a scared dog over just a few short sessions. Progress made with shy dogs can be some of the most <strong style="color:#FF5E99;">dramatic and rewarding experiences</strong> you'll have as a shelter volunteer.</li>

                  <li><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Movement is important.</strong> Allow the dog to move as much as the space allows; it gives her a choice in the situation. When a dog feels like she can move away freely, she will be more confident to approach.</li>

                <p>Most of these circular and slide touches are done with the back of the hand or with parts of your hand, which allows you to work up to more contact.</p>

                <p>Start by stetching the touches</p>

                <p>Do a couple, pause. Do a couple more, pause.</p>

                <p>Give her lots of time to adjust!</p>

                <p style="padding-left:25px;text-align:left;">Circular TTouches like Racoon or Clouded Leopard on and around the ear, and a slide from base to tip. Remember to replace ear, don't drop it.<br /><br /><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">If ears are pinned back:</strong> Determine if touch is appropriate at this moment. If so, circular touches like Baby Chimp or Raccoon or Clouded Leopard around the base and neck could be useful here.</p>
              </div>

              <aside class="notes">
                <p>EAR WORK: Shy dogs may tend to freeze and hold their breath. Ear work is great for promoting circulation and respiration.</p>

                <p>Remember to assess and reassess body language before you start touching sensitive areas. If her ears are pinned back, maybe start with a less sensitive area first.</p>

                <p style="font-size:85%;padding-left:25px;text-align:left;">If Tail is tightly tucked, try some Clouded Leopard TTouches around the base of the tail and on the tail, or LLama TTouch on the tail, or Noah's March sketched down the tail.<br /><br />Press the tail gently against the side of a leg.<br /><br />As the tail loosens on its own you can gently touch on the underside of the tail to lift it.</p>

              <aside class="notes">
                <p>Tail work: The tail position is especially useful for quickly assessing how a dog is feeling.</p>

                <p>Gently work around the base of the tail and sketch touches on the tail. Pressing the tail to the back of the leg can help bring awareness to the whole back end.</p>

                <p style="font-size:85%;padding-left:25px;text-align:left;">Check your touches - position, speed, and pressure matter<br /><br />You probably need to slow down and use either more or less pressure.<br /><br /><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Pro Tip:</strong> If you cannot touch with your hand, <strong style="color:#FF5E99;">try using a toy to sketch touches instead</strong>. If cannot touch on her body with toy, draw circle and a quarter on ground with toy. Repeat in random places. Show her what you're doing. Try to touch again. Repeat as needed.</p>

              <p style="font-size:85%;padding-left:25px;text-align:left;">Introduce to her to its smell, maybe use food if she is taking food. If intro goes okay, try draping it over her shoulders. Maybe cross in front of chest. Maybe wrap it around her - quarter or half wrap. Then do some touches on the wrap!<br /><br /><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Pro Tip:</strong> Even if you cannot put the wrap on fully, try to drape it on her and do some touches on the wrap.</p>

                <p style="font-size:85%;padding-left:25px;text-align:left;">If you plan to take the dog out, a harness is highly recommended. Again, make sure you know how to put it on a dog!! Size it before putting it on. If she is taking food, offer food by sticking hand through the harness. As she takes the food, slip the harness over her head.<br /><br /><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Pro Tip:</strong> Face the same direction as the dog as you harness her. Pause frequently to reconnect and assess.</p>

                <p style="font-size:85%;padding-left:25px;text-align:left;">Leash her using two points of contact. Keep the leash loose. Give the dog as much autonomy as possible and let her choose when she's ready to go!<br /><br /><strong style="color:#FF5E99;">Pro Tip:</strong> Clip the leash onto 2 different pieces of equipment, e.g., the harness and the collar. This way, if she pulls out of one, you will still have her by the other.</p>

                <li>You might not get to do any of the steps above, or you might get to do all of them. Allow your shy friend to pleasantly surprise you with more progress than you planned but resist the urge to do "just one more".</li>
