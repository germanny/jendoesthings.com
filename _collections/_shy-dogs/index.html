          <h2>Shy Dogs Need Exceptional Help<br />TTouch Can Provide</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>It can take longer to develop a relationship with a shy or scared dog.</li>
            <li>Shy Dogs are often overlooked by adopters and volunteers while boisterous dogs demand more attention.</li>
            <li>Some shy and scared dogs offer "distance increasing" signals (e.g., lip curling, piloerection (raised hackles), showing teeth, snapping, etc.) that are misunderstood or off-putting.</li>
            <li>Getting to know a shy or scared dog takes patience and often small sacrifices on the part of the humans.</li>

          <h3>Why Help a Shy Dog?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Shy Dogs may be euthanized for behaviors they offer, or for tying up kennels too long, or developing illnesses during long shelter stays, etc.</li>
            <li>Done carefully, you can make a lot of progress with a shy dog over just a few short sessions.</li>
            <li>Progress made with shy, fearful, and "shut-down" dogs can be some of the most dramatic and rewarding experiences you'll have as a shelter volunteer.</li>

              <li>The Tellington TTouch Method is comprised of 4 components:
                <ul>
                  <li>Gentle body work called Tellington TTouch comprised of circular touches, lifts, and slides;</li>
                  <li>Ground, movement exercises called the Playground for Higher Learning;</li>
                  <li>Tellington Training Equipment, including harnesses and body wraps;</li>
                  <li>Intention: picturing how you want your dog to behave with the realization that you can "Change Your Mind & Change Your Animal."</li>

          <h3>Why Use TTouch to Help Shy Shelter Dogs?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>TTouch helps you focus on the dog in front of you, to be in this moment with the dog, present in mind, body, and spirit.</li>
            <li>TTouch is about taking the time to build relationships and giving the dog the space she needs to build confidence, learn to trust your touch, and cope with the environment around her.</li>
            <li>TTouch can help increase a dog's tolerance for touch, people, situations, and the environment, reduce stress, and improve posture.</li>
            <li>Dogs who participate in TTouch activities often get adopted from our seminars and classes. People want the kind of confident, trusting, and calm dogs TTouch helps to create.</li>
            <li>TTouch improves our own quality of life by helping us slow down, breathe, and be in the moment with our dogs.</li>

          <h3>It's Like Dating, Really</h3>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>"Get Ready For Your Date":</strong> Just like you wouldn't go on a date without showering, dressing and accessorizing appropriately, and packing the essentials, don't go into a shy dog's kennel until you have your gear ready, treats open, poop bags stowed, toys handy, and a calm attitude.</li>
            <li><strong>"Meeting Your Date":</strong> As you enter a shy dog's kennel, be mindful of your body language, where you position yourself in relation to the dog, how you work with the dog, and the signals the dog offers. Make sure you are constantly re-assessing those things throughout your time together.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3>Get out your gear:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Harness</strong>: check clips, adjust size, make sure it's clean. Know how to put IT ON THE DOG! Practice putting equipment on other dogs. Only use equipment you've used hundreds of times with a shy dog.</li>
              <li><strong>Wraps</strong>: Get the wrap out and fold neatly, put it in a convenient place so you don't have to rummage for it.</li>
              <li><strong>Treats</strong>: Open your treats before you enter. Invest in a treat bag!</li>
              <li><strong>Toys</strong>: If there are toys in kennel, use them. Otherwise, bring toys of different sizes for play, "hand extenders", and sometimes for safety.</li>
              <li><strong>Poop bags, camera, phones, jacket, etc.</strong>: Stow these so you have if them if needed but so they aren't falling all over the place.</li>

              <li>Create a picture in your head of things you might like to do with her.</li>
              <li>Bring gear for many scenarios beyond your plan.</li>
              <li>Don't pressure her to do something she doesn't want to.</li>
              <li>Allow her to set the pace for your session.</li>
              <li>Be ready to do something different if the moment changes.</li>
              <li>Even if you don't get to do anything you planned to do, at least you tried and you'll be more likely to make a connection in the future.</li>
              <li>Remember - moments, not minutes.</li>

        <section>
          <h4>Enter the kennel quietly as possible.</h4>
          <p>Not just vocally quiet; quiet your body. Get in, turn sideways, look and look away. Do not sit right away; remain standing sideways. Treat toss. Smile slightly with mouth closed. Speak softly. Don't turn your back.</p>

          <p>Always be assessing the dog. Watch for changes in her body language that indicate movement. If she becomes "forward" and tense, offer "calming signals" and be prepared to exit if needed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section>
            <h4>Watch for any softening of the body language.</h4>
            <p>If safe, squat but keep your feet under you with posture upright. If safe, slowly move toward her. Speak in low tones. Treat toss. <em>Show you have value.</em></p>

        <section>
          <h4>Try a touch:</h4>
          <p>As the dog tolerates you, see if you can touch her. Noah's March or Llama TTouch works well (as it is done with the back of the hand). Sketch one or two touches, stop. Try again. Watch body language.</p>

          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you cannot touch with your hand, <strong>try using a toy to sketch touches instead</strong>. If cannot touch on her body with toy, draw circle and a quarter on ground with toy. Repeat in random places. Show her what you're doing. Try to touch again. Repeat as needed.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <section>
            <h4>Add touches as she becomes more comfortable</h4>

            <p>Add touches to relieve tension, build confidence, and create a bond. Start by using touches touches that employ less contact and give her breaks after every couple of touches. Sketch touches at first. Pay attention to speed and pressure.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Noah's March</li>
              <li>Llama</li>
              <li>Clouded Leopard</li>
              <li>Chimp and Orangutan</li>
              <li>Raccoon</li>
              <li>Lying Leopard</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h5>Ear work</h5>
            <p>Circular TTouches like Racoon or Clouded Leopard on and around the ear, and a slide from base to tip. Remember to replace ear, don't drop it.</p>

            <p><strong>If ears are pinned back:</strong> Determine if touch is appropriate at this moment. If so, circular touches like Baby Chimp or Raccoon or Clouded Leopard around the base and neck could be useful here.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h5>Tail work</h5>
            <p>If Tail is tightly tucked, try some Clouded Leopard TTouches around the base of the tail and on the tail, or LLama TTouch on the tail, or Noah's March sketched down the tail.</p>

            <p>Press the tail gently against the side of a leg.</p>

            <p>As the tail loosens on its own you can gently touch on the underside of the tail to lift it.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>"Mindful Use of Touch"</h3>
            <p>Check your touches - position, speed, and pressure matter</p>
            <p>Everyone almost always needs to slow down, and either use more or less pressure.</p>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Try a wrap</h3>

          <p>Introduce to her to its smell, maybe use food if she is taking food. If intro goes okay, try draping it over her shoulders. Maybe cross in front of chest. Maybe wrap it around her - quarter or half wrap. Then do some touches on the wrap!</p>

          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Even if you cannot put the wrap on fully, try to drape it on her and do some touches on the wrap to get her used to it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Use a harness</h3>

          <p>If you plan to take the dog out, a harness is highly recommended. Again, make sure you know how to put it on a dog!! Size it before putting it on. If she is taking food, offer food by sticking hand through the harness. As she takes the food, slip the harness over her head.</p>

          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Face the same direction as the dog as you harness her. Pause frequently to reconnect and assess.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Leashing</h3>

          <p>Leash her using two points of contact. Keep the leash loose. Give the dog as much autonomy as possible and let her choose when she's ready to go!</p>

          <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Clip the leash onto 2 different pieces of equipment, e.g., the harness and the collar. This way, if she pulls out of one, you will still have her by the other.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Stay in the Moment</h2>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't rush to leave the kennel.</strong> Intermingle wrapping or harnessing with breaks for TTouch, treats, or just <em>being together</em>. Take the pressure off her. Find out where you can touch her, where she is sensitive, and any problem areas before you leave her kennel!</li>
            <li><strong>Movement is important.</strong> Allow the dog to move as much as the space allows; it gives her a choice in the situation. When a dog feels like she can move away freely, she will be more confident to approach.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Go at the dog’s pace</h2>

          <p>You might not get to do any of the steps above, or you might get to do all of them. Allow your shy friend to pleasantly surprise you with more progress than you planned, but also know when enough is enough.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>You can't put a timeline on trust</h2>

          <p>But by skillfully using TTouch, wraps, and other equipment to create little moments and giving her a little autonomy whenever possible, you can build a great relationship a with a shy shelter.</p>
